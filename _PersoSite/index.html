					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<p> By being intorduced to Information Technologies at an early age, Glenn Duguid has always had a passion for computers. When combining this focus with his indepth technical knowledge, he is able to create work of a supperior standard. Through his involvment in DECO1800, Glenn has expanded his technical skills and improved his ability to communicate </p>
					
					<p>Throughout the semester, I have also proven my work ethic within a team environment. I order ensure ‘The End is Neigh’ projects success, I developed the initial poster and created the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) almost exclusively. This was due to the limitations of the group members, however the project exceeded expectations, justifying any extra personal effort.

					<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
					<p><h3>Design Proposal</h3>During the initial iterations of the design, 404ERROR wanted to extract the interest out of the dark theme. We knew that we wanted to singularly focus on the newspaper section of TROVE. We felt that this was the most relevant section to the team’s goal, and provided unique context to the applications user.</p>
					<p>Being experienced with Photoshop, it was decided that I would complete the poster and Ross would handle the pitch. Although this was only partially realised, with the pitch being improvised between Ross and I, this section of the Major Project was completed to a highly acceptable standard.</p>

					<p><h3>Work-in-Progress</h3>
					<a href='MVPindex.html'>Link to MVP</a></br>
					To create a functioning site, it was decided that I would personally create the MVP. Being the most capable in HTML, CSS and JavaScript; the key areas to complete were:</p>
					<img src='img/MVP.jpg' atl='MVP'/>
					<br/>
					<p>As the core designer up to this point in the project, it was interesting to see the commonality of the returned results era. It was clear that the application explored a pivotal time in Australia’s young history. The reoccurring themes presented a bleak social outlook during the early 1900’s.  It was clear that the underlying principles of ‘Armageddon’ were a total possibility to the people of the time, creating a sense of uncertainty and respect in the applications user.</p>
					<p>This created contextual awareness in the user, provided purpose to our project.</p>
					<p>In a technical sense, the flow chart expressed below highlights the codes efficiency. I was having some trouble trying to figure out how to deal with the displaying the article. My original response from Trove only included the ‘article text’ field. Personally, this was unacceptable for an interactive site. Displaying articles from the above period, the charm was completely lost in translation to a digital formal. This was solved by using “reclevel=full” within the URL of the Trove call.</p>

					<p><h3>Final Delivery</h3>The final delivery was a pivotal period for 404ERROR. By this stage, I pleaded the group to help me finish the project. It was then decided that I would run the testing session to understand the final features and the other members would do the code to touch up the MVP.</p>
					<p>In terms of design, I think as a team, we produce a functional application. We obviously took the advice from the testing session, incorporating a navigation bar and convenient access to the search parameter.</p>
					<p>Within the testing session, the MVP prototype was used to see how the user group would interact with the application. It was assumed that the respondents were familiar in the Trove API and general design principals; making them experts within the area. The session was run in an informal conversation format, using open ended questions to receive the participants qualitative feedback.</p>
					<p>As a team, we found the conclusions deducted from the session were an invaluable resource. It was great to clear up any niggling design decisions. There were also great suggestions on new ideas the team had not full considered. The feedback has been summarised below.</p>

					<p><h3>Portfolio</h3>The main purpose of the portfolio was to showcase the skills I have learnt within course. Although simple, I think the design represents my personal style well:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Simplistic</li>
						<li>Functional</li>
						<li>Creative</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The component that I am most proud of is the navigation bar. Creating a ‘bloggie’ style of website, I was finding it hard to deal with the navigation. The user of the site is considered to only interact with it on one occasion. Therefore, I decided to have a singular page design, utilising JavaScript to scroll the window to the desired section. The code I wrote to accomplish this was both elegant and efficient.</p>

					<p>At the start of the year, I thought JavaScript was cult in Indonesia: </p>

					<h2>REFLECTION</h2>
					<p>In reflection, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time doing DECO1800. Although I found some aspects of the course challenging, I have the firm belief that I will use the skills I have developed in the semester. It was encouraging to find the clear progression from previous subjects. It is unbelievable to see how comfortable I have becoming in using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I find the problem-solving aspect of coding highly addicting, often finding myself passing out at the desk. </p>
					<p> In a technical standpoint, I thought using the Trove API was the perfect task to make the students complete. It required you to dig through the documentation to find the answer to a problem, going against the common “just google it!” logic. I now feel comfortable going through unfamiliar API’s.</p>
					<p> The main change I would make to the course, would be the group structure of the assessment. Not fully understanding how heavily we would be dependent on each other, I was shocked at how little some of the members did. As stated above, I’m still extremely happy with the outcome of the course, but it was rather frustrating that if I wanted good marks, the effort was all mine. The only thing that suffered, my blog ;)</p>
